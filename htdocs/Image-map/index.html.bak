		<p> Above is the logo for all of my 9 favorite games, I gathered on the internet. They are all very well-developed games. My favorite game category, which is MMORPG, open-world, and heavy-based storyline. They all have proven themself to fit my expectation.</p>

        <p>As for the semi-open world and storyline, we have the God of War series 1-4( the logo above is for part4) and  The last of us(1 and 2). They all have been awarded the Game of the year title in 2018 and 2020. The information about the story, gameplay, and how to get it can be found when you click on their logo.</p>

        <p>For the best survival game, I would give the first place to Minecraft as it is an old-time classic and all-time best game. Rust is for the try-hard survival gamer who like to be in a harsh environment and the penalty for in-game death is cruel. Lastly, if you like taming animals, pre-historic, and chill survival gameplay, Ark is the best for you. All 3 games have multiplayer.</p>
        <p>For MMORPG, Genshin Impact, GTA 5, and Red Dead Redemption 2 take place as favorites in my heart. Genshin has many similarities to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the wild. The game it is based on is already very great, but know there are multiplayer with it. GTA 5 doesn't have an in-depth story like its previous parts. However, talking about the humor and ridiculousness of a game, GTA 5 did great giving the player good giggles and laughs. Finally, for Red Dead, maybe I like it because I just want to be a cowboy! (but for real, y'all should play it).
        <p>For a horror game, FNAF 1 gave me the most horrifying experience with a very unique gameplay set up at that time. There are many sequels after it, some are good, some are not but Fnaf 1 is still the best for me.</p>
